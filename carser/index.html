        I have completed a Diploma in Computer Technology under MSBTE (Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education).
        During my studies, I learned programming languages such as C, Object-Oriented Programming with C++, and Core
        Java.

        After that, I entered the field of web development, starting with HTML and CSS. I created some basic projects to
        strengthen my understanding. Then, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, followed by PHP, and developed
        additional projects using those technologies.

        Later, I explored Python and continued to improve my JavaScript skills. With this knowledge and experience, I
        eventually created this portfolio to showcase my work and progress.

                GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration, primarily for coding
                projects. It
                allows developers to store, track, and manage changes to their code using Git, a distributed version
                control
                system. With GitHub, multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously, propose changes, and
                review each other's work through features like pull requests and issues. It also hosts repositories
                publicly
                or privately, making it a powerful tool for both open-source contributions and private development
                projects.
